# must contain a list of conditions (associative arrays) with following properties:
# - `condition` must be a unique string
# - `medium`, `duration`, `interval` must be lists 
# (of the same length for a given condition) or scalars (value is recycled)
# - `paths` are lists of strings
# - other custom fields can be added (must be scalar!)
# - for a given concdition, several `series` can be declared as a list 
# containing paths and other custom fields (see below). NB: sicne series are 
# *not* named, (at least one) custom field must be used to distinguish them.
# For the rest, any valid YAML syntax should be accepted (mind tabs vs spaces).
