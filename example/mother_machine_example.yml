# must contain a list of conditions (associative arrays) with following properties:
# - `condition` must be a unique string
# - `medium`, `duration`, `interval` must be lists 
# (of the same length for a given condition) or scalars (value is recycled)
# NB: list are casted to the type of their first element, hence `[3., 1.5]` is read as a vector but `[3, 1.5]` is read as a list (and raises an error)
# NB: ".inf" can be used for `Inf` but only in a list of float (hence `[720., .inf]` is read correctly but `[720, .inf]` raises an error])
# - `paths` are lists of strings
# - other custom fields can be added (must be scalar!)
# - for a given condition, several `series` can be declared as a list 
# containing paths and other custom fields (see below). NB: since series are 
# *not* named, (at least one) custom field must be used to distinguish them.
# For the rest, any valid YAML syntax should be accepted (mind tabs vs spaces).
